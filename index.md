# CSE 110
I want to learn how to develop long-lasting programs and maintain them, rather than simply discarding them once I am complete. A couple of things I would like to learn include:
- [ ] JUnit testing. Something like this:
```
@Suite.SuiteClasses({ 
   TestJunit1.class ,TestJunit2.class
})
```
- [ ] Code Reviews
- [ ] Agile Development and Methodology

# Current Projects
1. **[Engineers For Exploration:](https://github.com/UCSD-E4E/MMICT)** We are developing a web application that takes uploaded drone imagery from researchers, uses a pretrained model to classify mangrove areas, and return it to the users. My role has been in setting up authentication through Auth0, Database connections and API calls through MongoDB, and currently helping deploy initial production builds in AWS.

2. **[Triton Robotics:](https://github.com/Triton-Robotics/TR-CV-2024.git)** As part of the Computer Vision team, we help to train the robot to point and "lock on" to enemy robots to fire at. I have worked in developing a kalman filtering test program to help improve velocity calculations, as well as setting up UART serial communication between the NVIDIA Jetson and STMN32.

3. **[Dougu Equipment App:]** Developing a mobile app to help improve equipment management for the Taiko team I am a part of. Current in internal testing on both Google play console and Apple Test Flight, I utilized react native and AWS amplify to get the app up and running. [Image](./images/Dougu.jpg)
